# yodl

...not to be confused with [mgrahamjo/yodel](https://github.com/mgrahamjo/yodel), stands for **Yo**utube **D**own**l**oader. It is a wrapper for [fent/node-ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core), just like [JimmyBoh/pully](https://github.com/JimmyBoh/pully) and [fent/node-ytdl](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl). It (will) take inspiration from those two as well.
