# yodl

...not to be confused with [mgrahamjo/yodel](https://github.com/mgrahamjo/yodel), stands for **Yo**utube **D**own**l**oader. It is a wrapper for [fent/node-ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core), just like [JimmyBoh/pully](https://github.com/JimmyBoh/pully) and [fent/node-ytdl](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl). It (will) take inspiration from those two as well. Because of that, I was originally going to name it "yet another node youtube downloader wrapper", but 'yanydw' doesn't roll off the tongue as well. 

One of the key features that are planned is **queue processing.** That is coming soon!
