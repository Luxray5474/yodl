It is a wrapper for [fent/node-ytdl-core](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl-core), just like [JimmyBoh/pully](https://github.com/JimmyBoh/pully) and [fent/node-ytdl](https://github.com/fent/node-ytdl). It (will) take inspiration from those two as well. Because of that, I was originally going to name it \"yet another node youtube downloader wrapper\", but 'yanydw' doesn't roll off the tongue as well.",
